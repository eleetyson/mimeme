*Mimeme* is Greek for 'that which is imitated'. It's in reference to this word that evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins coined the term *meme* in his 1976 book, The Selfish Gene:
> "We need a name for the new replicator, a noun that conveys the idea of a unit of cultural transmission, or a unit of imitation."

More than 40 years later with the advent of social media, this concept has evolved in ways that Dawkins could never have fathomed.

As we increasingly communicate through images and bursts of short, choppy messages, memes pervade our everyday lives.
